***WELCOME TO MY CREATION >:)***
Yeah, this is just me messing around to see what goofy things I can make.

If you find it interesting, you should try making your own :>
I don't really know what I'm doing, like, *at all*, so I'm *sure* it'll go well.

I've never even used github before today, honestly, so I legitimately have no idea what I'm doing.
I just saw a website with a cool font and I thought "hey I wanna make that" so here I am, 11 PM,
about to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript or whatever I need to make my own website from scratch.
Why not use a website editor? Because I really cannot be bothered. And I also don't wanna pay.
And it's literally just something for me only.
